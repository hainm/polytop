# PolyTop

A topology builder for polymers. [Click here to go to the web app.](https://lilyminium.github.io/polytop/webapp.html)

## Features
Currently PolyTop only supports GROMACS .itp topologies and .pdb coordinates.

## Usage
This relies on the user already having coordinates (.pdbs) and topologies (.itps) for 
each unit fragment of their molecule. You can get these at the [ATB](https://atb.uq.edu.au/).

You may have to manually highlight the PDB file text and paste it into a text document. This 
will get fixed.



### Error reporting

If something is happening that you think shouldn't, please raise an issue or 
email me at 
[lily.wang@anu.edu.au](mailto:lily.wang@anu.edu.au) with the following:
- What you were trying to do
- What it did
- The current state (File > Save universe)
- What you can see in the Javascript console
    - **Firefox**: Ctrl+Shift+K
    - **Chrome**: Ctrl+Shift+I
    - **Safari**: Develop > Show Error Console (turn on Developer tools in Safari > Preferences > Advanced)
    - **Edge**: F12 > Console

    There is likely an error message there in red. If there's a > arrow, try clicking on it
    and screenshotting the error trace.
- Browser and version
- Molecule files

Thank you <3

## To do
- accept all the coordinate formats NGL does
- accept topology formats from other MD engines
- fix z-index placement of unit selection panels
- document
- add interface to customise visualisation past ball+stick
- add animation interface
- highlight fragments in the side-viewport when adding units
- add user guide
- make overlay panels move-able
